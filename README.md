# Boggle

This is some code that plays boggle. It doesn't handle the special "QU" and "TH" squares, but it works.

The file "dict.txt" should contain a new line seperated list of words. I found a scrabble dictionary on the interweb, but I couldn't really verify its provinence so It's not included here.
